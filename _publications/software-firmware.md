Accelerating [trigger](https://cds.cern.ch/record/433826/files/p318.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} applications on FPGAs (using VHDL/Verilog) at the CMS experiment at CERN's Large Hadron Collider warrants consistency between each trigger firmware and its corresponding C++ model. This tedious and time consuming process of convergence is exacerbated during each upgrade study. High-level synthesis, with its promise of increased productivity and C++ design entry bridges this gap exceptionally well. This paper explores the "single source code" approach using Vivado-HLS tool for redeveloping the upgraded CMS Endcap Muon Level-1 Track finder (EMTF). Guidelines for tight latency control, optimal resource usage and compatibility with CMS software framework are outlined in this paper.
